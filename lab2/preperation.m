%% Questions

% ------------------------------ 1) ------------------------------ %
% It is possible to estimate the time delay for different paths but
% it's basically impossible to find all time delayed signals coming in
% using only geometry.

% It's impossible to find the time delays by comparing the observed signal
% and the real one.

% It is possible to find the time delays by looking at the peaks of the
% cross-correlation function. E.g if Ryu(i) is large then it is likely that
% u(t-i) is a component in the received signal y. One drawback is that you
% can't know what the coefficients in front of the delayed signals are.

% It is possible, look at preparation exercise 4 for example. There we knew
% the model order needed to be 7 but if we were unsure we could have chosen
% a larger value and gotten the same result, with some extra parameter 
% being close to 0 of course. A drawback of this method is that we don't
% know the model order so to be sure we might have to use really large
% model order. 


% ------------------------------ 2) ------------------------------ %
% The step length affects how fast the parameter convergences and the
% variance once it has converged. If it's small the convergence will
% take longer but the variance will be smaller, and vice versa. LMS doesn't
% work for an arbitrary step length since once the equation 
% |eig(I-Âµ*phi*phi')| >= 1 the system becomes unstable (poles outside unit
% circle).

% ------------------------------ 3) ------------------------------ %
% To evaluate a model one can look at epsilon(k) = y(k)-phi(k)'*theta(k-1).
% This gives an indication of how the real model have changed since the
% last time instance. If it's high the current parameters are no good
% anymore.
